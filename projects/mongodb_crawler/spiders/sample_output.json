Kavita and Prem were the best hosts any one could ask for, nothing was too much. The food was excellent and really tasty!!! They made our family feel so special ‚ù£Ô∏è.The Hindi music request was granted immediately, with a special pakara starter on the house! To top it up, they gave my sister a present at the end of the birthday celebration, a scarf from Nepal. We would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to celebrate with friends or family üçæüíùüåπüíïüíØ"}

Had never ordered Nepalese food before, and Prem was so helpful and patient, making sure we had everything we needed but not pushing additional items at all.  On the day, Prem turned up right on time and was such a lovely person to chat to.  Thrilled to see that the large order was completely correct, plus some added unexpected - free - items which added to the general merriment of the day.  The food itself was delicious. Everything we ordered was piping hot, well balanced in terms of spice, and the meat was tender and good quality.  Looking forward to having cause to order again.  Thank you for helping to make the day so special."}

There is a lovely bar area next door to restaurant with a beautiful open fire.\n\nI would book as restaurant was pretty busy.  From Oxford we are Cowley area its a short cab ride so don't be put off that's its not central Oxford.\n\nWe will defiantly be returning this month with friends.\n\nThank you Gurkha palace we had a fab night."}

However, when I visited, I found out that the new owners are the people behind Yeti on Cowley Road (which was one of the best places for curry in Oxford).\n\nAn interesting menu which has a mix of Nepalese dishes and Indian classics, served quickly by staff who are knowledgeable and genuinely friendly (without being overbearing). Everything we tried was excellent, and I'll certainly be coming back.\n\nIf anyone can make a success of a restaurant here, it's them."}

{"_id":{"$oid":"6266773ffd87e0ec84304228"},"title":"Must be the best curry in Oxford","text":"It‚Äôs fantastic to have a great curry house in the village again. The Chequers (aka The Gurkha Palace), has new owners with a mouth watering menu. \nI have dined in once & had 2 takeaways since they opened a couple of weeks ago. It was awesome, every time. Nothing left on my plate! I think the poppadoms are probably the best I have ever tasted, the tamarind chutney is to die for. Highly recommend."}

We‚Äôre not short of options (Cowley Road, Wheatley, etc), but what draws us back is the quality of the food. The chicken momos are delicious constructs of wonder. The Mughal-style dishes are done sympathetically. And the kitchen‚Äôs output is of a consistently high quality. The service is friendly. \n\nGreat food in convivial surroundings."}
